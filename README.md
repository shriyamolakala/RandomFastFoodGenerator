# RandomFastFoodGenerator
* This program gives the user the opportunity to get a random fast food order from a fast food restaurant. 
* The user will be asked if they are vegetarian or not and will be given an order based on their input.
* This program is useful if anyone is ever conflicted on where
to eat or what to eat at a fast food restaurant, and if they want an option that is completely random.
